Good Evening!

Here is the simple instruction for the Task management that I created

To add task simple click the add task to create
TN: you can notice that the context are squiggling when you try to add task it is because the required filled are not filled up properly
To delete the task you can click the delete button to delete the task
To change the status you can try to click the mark as done or mark as backlog as the status and it will be transfered depending on the choice that you will choose
